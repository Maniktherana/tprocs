- use bun commands wherever possible for building
- if you don't know anything, either ask for docs references or refer to the `deepwiki` cli
- Never commit anything unless the user specifically asks
- Don't lint or format after every change.
- Ask instead of assuming
- Don't write throwaway tests

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be a ed. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- avoid calling functions with `void someAsyncFunctionCall()`
- Avoid `try`/`catch` with empty `catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json();

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json");
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json();
```

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2;

// Bad
let foo;
if (condition) foo = 1;
else foo = 2;
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1;
  return 2;
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1;
  else return 2;
}
```

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck`, never `tsc` directly.
